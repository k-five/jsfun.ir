        <p>In the topic <a href="../../the-world-of-javascript">the-world-of-javascript</a> I talked about history of evolving Web, JavaScript and their behavior.</p>
        <p>We realized that we did not have a major change till ES6 (=2015).</p>
        <p>Before ES6 browsers were ahead of the Standard, after this major change, browsers are behind and still trying to catch the standard and therefore tools like webpack and babel emerge.</p>
        <p>In the series I briefly explain important features in ES6 and after it.</p>
        <p>If you saw any mistakes please notify me or you can update the blog on github.</p>
        <p>Link of each page is available at the bottom of that says: "Edit on Github".</p>
