        <hr>
        <p>In <a href="../../the-world-of-javascript">the world of javascript</a> I explained why we have to use tolls like <strong>webpack</strong> or babel. Please read; so you do not get confused by proceeding the rest.</p>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Babel</h3>
        <p>If you open <a target="_blank" href="https://babeljs.io/">babeljs.io</a> the first thing you see is: <strong>Babel is a JavaScript compiler</strong> which is not quite right!.</p>
        <p>We know why they say this, because it sounds very c ol :) to write a compiler, but the reality is that it is a <strong>transpiler</strong>.</p>
        <p>For more please read:</p>

            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler">Source-to-source compiler</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important because Dynamic Programming Language do not need to be compiled, they have interpreter. Although we have compiler optimization phase within V8, but still there is no need for a user to use a tool for compiling. Execution happens at runtime.</p>
        <p>The short story is that before ES6, major browsers were ahead of standard, so all of our code could be run.</p>
        <p>But after ES6 not all browsers completely support ES6!</p>
        <p>Solution?</p>
        <p>A tool to convert ES6 code to ES5 that all browsers can parse. That is it.</p>
