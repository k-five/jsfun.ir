        <p>While in 1991 we had 2 websites, one in Europe in CERN and after that the second one in US in Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, but the growth rate was not leaner! It was too exponential.</p>
        <p class="quote">Paul Kunz from SLAC visited Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in September 1991. He was impressed by the WWW project and brought a copy of the software back to Stanford. SLAC launched the first web server in North America on December 12, 1991.[3]</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">web browsers emerging, 1992, 1993</h3>
        <p>One of the places that spent researching about how to browse the web was: <strong>National Center for Supercomputing Applications</strong> (= NSCA).</p>
        <p>And one of their project was a browser named <strong>NCSA Mosaic</strong>.</p>
        <p>At the same time we have other browsers like</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="quote">Line mode browser release 1.1 available by anonymous FTP (see news). Presentation to AIHEP'92 at La Londe (FR).</li>
            <li class="quote">29th April: Release of Finnish "Erwise" GUI client for X mentioned in review by TimBL</li>
            <li class="quote">Pei Wei's "Viola" GUI browser for X test version dated May 15. (See review by TimBL) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>So people one after another are creating web browsers.</p>

        <p>In 1994 Tim Berners-Lee left CERN.</p>
        <p class="quote">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS)</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">popularizing the web</h3>
        <p>One of the browsers that popularized the web was Mosaic by NCSA.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="/build/img/1993.mosaic.jpg" alt="1993.mosaic.jpg">
        <p class="quote">Mosaic was developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)[5] at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign beginning in late 1992. NCSA released the browser in 1993,[7] and officially discontinued development and support on January 7, 1997.</p>
        <p>The important things about developing Mosaic is one of the core developers. <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>.</p>
        <p class="quote">After trying ViolaWWW, David Thompson demonstrated it to the NCSA software design group.[9] This inspired Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina - two programmers working at NCSA - to create Mosaic. Andreessen and Bina originally designed and programmed NCSA Mosaic for Unix's X Window System called xmosaic.</p>

        <p>Why? Because Mr. Andreessen left NCSA</p>
        <p class="quote">Marc Andreessen, the leader of the team that developed Mosaic, left NCSA and, with James H. Clark, one of the founders of Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), and four other former students and staff of the University of Illinois, started <strong>Mosaic Communications Corporation</strong>.</p>
        <p class="quote">Marc Andreessen and colleagues leave NCSA to form "Mosaic Communications Corp" (later Netscape).</p>
        <p>Two key features of Mosaic Browser</p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p class="quote">Mosaic was also the first browser to display images inline with text instead of displaying images in a separate window</p>
        <p>2.</p>
        <p class="quote"> A port of Mosaic to the Commodore Amiga was available by October 1993. NCSA Mosaic for Unix (X-Windows) version 2.0 was released on November 10, 1993.[12] Version 1.0 for Microsoft Windows was released on November 11, 1993.[13][14] From 1994 to 1997, the National Science Foundation supported the further development of Mosaic.</p>
        <p>So showing images to the users and available on Windows OS other than just Unix made it easy that this browser got popular and further popularizing the web as well.</p>
        <p>For example number of web sites was about 2 in 1991.</p>
        <p>In 1992 more than 10.</p>
        <p>In 1993 more than 600.</p>
        <p>In 1994 exceeded more than 10,000 by the end of the year!</p>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Internet Explorer</h3>
        <p>Like the story of Microsoft's DOS product that originally was not theirs, Internet Explorer was not either.</p>
        <p class="quote">Starting in 1995 Mosaic lost market share to Netscape Navigator, and by 1997 only had a tiny fraction of users left, by which time the project was discontinued. Microsoft licensed Mosaic to create <strong>Internet Explorer in 1995</strong>.</p>

        <p>So, lets go to 1995 to see the result of browser competitions.</p>
