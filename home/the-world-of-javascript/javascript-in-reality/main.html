        <p>While usually in other programming languages we first has <strong>specification</strong> and then based on that <strong>standardization</strong> and later <strong>implementation</strong>; it is not completely true for JavaScript.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">before ES6</h3>
        <p>Even at the beginning to compete with Microsoft, Netscape wanted to have a scripting language as soon as possible. So the main / core idea, the goal was not to have a well designed programming language but rather <strong>reaching the market of dynamic web browser</strong>.</p>
        <p>This start leads us to the second odd thing about javascript which is <strong>standardization</strong> is usually behind <strong>implementation</strong>!</p>
        <p>Which means web browsers because of the market and businesses needs implement a feature and it works whereas this feature has not been standardized by others yet!</p>
        <p>For example XHR (= XML HTTP Request), which we had ti working in some browsers before it becomes standard.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">after ES6</h3>
        <p>But the game changed by releasing <strong>ES6</strong> which finally added most of the features that JavaScript needed for years like <strong>declaring block scope variable.</strong></p>
        <p>Remember we have C programming language in <strong>1972</strong>? It has block scope variable, but JavaScript did not have till <strong>2015</strong>!</p>
        <p>So the coin flipped and now <strong>implementation</strong> is behind <strong>standardization</strong>! That is why we have <strong>babel</strong> and <strong>webpack</strong>; to convert new ES6 (= 2015) standard to ES5 (= 2009) that all browser can handle it correctly. </p>


        <h3 class="sub-title">market! web browsers! standardization!</h3>
        <p>Lacking consistency between thesee three pieces, most of the time causes headache for developers who are dealing with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Can we get rid of this nature in JavaScript? Maybe, who knows for sure?</p>

        <p>Lets have a look at ECMAScript which is the standardization version of JavaScript.</p>
