        <p class="quote">React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS".[29][30] He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.[31] It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.[30]</p>

        <p>We have <strong>Vue.js</strong> in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process: "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight."[12] The first source code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014. </p>
