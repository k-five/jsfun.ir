        <p>A quick review of events from 1996 till 2000.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">1996</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is up and running. Brenden Eich submits it to ECMA so it can be standardized.</p>
        <p>From Microsoft ...</p>
        <p class="quote">Microsoft script technologies including VBScript and JScript were released in 1996. JScript, a reverse-engineered implementation of Netscape's JavaScript, was part of Internet Explorer 3. </p>
        <p>Multi-implementation started to emerge.</p>
        <p class="quote">Internet Explorer 3 also included Microsoft's first support for CSS and various extensions to HTML, but in each case the implementation was noticeably different from that found in Netscape Navigator at the time.[27][28] </p>
        <p>Standardization ...</p>
        <p class="quote">In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International to carve out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at Netscape.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">1997</h3>
        <p>We have ES1 in this year, because of standardization.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's <strong>JScript</strong> came out. Why? Simple.</p>
        <p class="quote">[Microsoft] did not want to deal with Sun Microsystems about the trademark issue, and so they called their implementation JScript. A lot of people think that JScript and JavaScript are different but similar languages. That's not the case. They are just different names for the same language, and the reason the names are different was to get around trademark issues.[5]</p>
        <p class="quote">This led to the official release of the language specification ECMAScript published in the first edition of the ECMA-262 standard in June 1997, ...</p>
        <p><strong>Google</strong> came out also.</p>
        <p class="quote">Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">1998</h3>
        <p>We have ES2 in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">The release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 continued the standards process cycle, conforming some modifications to the ISO/IEC 16262 international standard. ...</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">1999</h3>
        <p class="quote">ECMAScript 3 was released in December 1999 and is the modern-day baseline for JavaScript. ...</p>
        <p>Also we have <strong>XHR</strong> or <strong>XML Http Request</strong>.</p>
        <p>We have ES3 in this year. But it became standard in 2006.</p>
        <p class="quote">The concept behind the XMLHttpRequest object was originally created by the developers of Outlook Web Access (by Microsoft) for Microsoft Exchange Server 2000.[4] An interface called IXMLHTTPRequest was developed and implemented into the second version of the MSXML library using this concept.[4][5] The second version of the MSXML library was shipped with Internet Explorer 5.0 in March 1999, allowing access, via ActiveX, to the IXMLHTTPRequest interface using the XMLHTTP wrapper of the MSXML library.[6]</p>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2000</h3>
        <p>In this year we have ES4 but it never released.</p>
        <p>And sadly in 2004 it was abandoned. And its named switched to ES3.1 which again this name also renamed to ES5 in 2009.</p>
        <p class="quote">The original ECMAScript 4 work led by Waldemar Horwat (then at Netscape, now at Google) started in 2000. Microsoft initially participated and implemented some proposals in their JScript .NET language. </p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p class="quote">Over time it was clear that Microsoft had no intention of cooperating or implementing proper JavaScript in Internet Explorer, even though they had no competing proposal and they had a partial (and diverged at this point) implementation on the .NET server side. So by 2003, the original ECMAScript 4 work was mothballed.</p>
        <p>We have <strong>dot-com crash</strong> in this year.</p>
