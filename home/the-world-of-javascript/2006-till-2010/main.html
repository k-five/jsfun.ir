        <p>We have <strong>JQuery</strong> in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">jQuery was originally created in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig, influenced by Dean Edwards' earlier cssQuery library.[10][11] It is currently maintained by a team of developers led by Timmy Willison (with the jQuery selector engine, Sizzle, being led by Richard Gibson).[12]</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2009</h3>
        <p>Renaming ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript 5.</p>
        <p class="quote">In July 2008, the disparate parties on either side came together in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to rename ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript 5 and drive the language forward using an agenda that is known as Harmony. ECMAScript 5 was finally released in December 2009. </p>
        <p>We have <strong>Node.js</strong> in this year by Ryan Dahl.</p>
        <p class="quote">Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009,[25] about thirteen years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.[26] The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.[27]</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2010</h3>
        <p>We have <strong>backbone.js</strong> in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">Backbone.js is a JavaScript library with a RESTful JSON interface and is based on the Model–view–presenter (MVP) application design paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only hard dependency is on one JavaScript library,[2] Underscore.js, plus jQuery for use of the full library.[3] </p>
