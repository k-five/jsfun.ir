        <p>A quick review of events between 2001 till 2005</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2003</h3>
        <p>We have Mozilla in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">The <strong>Mozilla </strong> Foundation (stylized as moz://a) is a not-for-profit organization that exists to support and collectively lead the open source Mozilla project. Founded in July 2003, the organization sets the policies that govern development, operates key infrastructure and controls Mozilla trademarks and copyrights.</p>
        <p>Also we have <strong>Facebook</strong> in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">Facebook is a social networking service launched as FaceMash in July 2003, but later changing to TheFacebook on February 4, 2004.[1] It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommate and fellow Harvard University student Eduardo Saverin.[2] T</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2004</h3>
        <p>We have <strong>FireFox</strong> in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">In 1998, desperate to remain competitive, Netscape launched what would become the Mozilla Foundation to create a new browser using the open source software model. This work evolved into Firefox, first released by Mozilla in 2004. Firefox reached a 28% market share in 2011.[11]</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2005</h3>
        <p>We should have this release in 2005, but it did not happen till 2008.</p>
        <p class="quote">The next major event was in 2005, with two major happenings in JavaScript's history. First, Brendan Eich and Mozilla rejoined Ecma International as a not-for-profit member and work started on ECMAScript for XML (E4X), the ECMA-357 standard, which came from ex-Microsoft employees at BEA Systems (originally acquired as Crossgain). This led to working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in ActionScript 3 (ActionScript 3 was a fork of original ECMAScript 4). </p>
        <p>Why did this release take too much time? Simple.</p>
        <p class="quote">Alas, there was still turmoil between the various players; Douglas Crockford—then at Yahoo!—joined forces with Microsoft in 2007 to oppose ECMAScript 4, which led to the ECMAScript 3.1 effort. The development of ECMAScript 4 was never completed, but that work influenced subsequent versions.[30]</p>
        <p>Also we have the coin of term <strong>AJAX</strong> in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">The term Ajax was publicly used on 18 February 2005 by Jesse James Garrett in an article titled Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications, based on techniques used on Google pages.[1]</p>
        <p>And as part of of the standard it was approved for the first draft in 2006</p>
        <p class="quote">On 5 April 2006, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the first draft specification for the XMLHttpRequest object in an attempt to create an official Web standard.[11] The latest draft of the XMLHttpRequest object was published on 6 October 2016.[12]</p>
