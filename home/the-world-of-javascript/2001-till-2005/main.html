        <p>A quick review of events between 2001 till 2005</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2001</h3>

        <h3 class="sub-title">2005</h3>
        <p>We should have this release in 2005, but it did not happen till 2008.</p>
        <p class="quote">The next major event was in 2005, with two major happenings in JavaScript's history. First, Brendan Eich and Mozilla rejoined Ecma International as a not-for-profit member and work started on ECMAScript for XML (E4X), the ECMA-357 standard, which came from ex-Microsoft employees at BEA Systems (originally acquired as Crossgain). This led to working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in ActionScript 3 (ActionScript 3 was a fork of original ECMAScript 4). </p>
        <p>Why did this release take too much time? Simple.</p>
        <p class="quote">Alas, there was still turmoil between the various players; Douglas Crockford—then at Yahoo!—joined forces with Microsoft in 2007 to oppose ECMAScript 4, which led to the ECMAScript 3.1 effort. The development of ECMAScript 4 was never completed, but that work influenced subsequent versions.[30]</p>
