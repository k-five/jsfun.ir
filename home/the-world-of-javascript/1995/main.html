        <hr>
        <p>We are in 1995, the year that Brendan Eich created JavaScript; but the way it was created was not like the way a programming language is usually created.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Microsoft vs. Netscape</h3>
        <p>We know Microsoft from <strong>1975</strong>, right? And Netscape by Marc Andresson in <strong>1994</strong>.</p>
        <p>Both of them have focused on the marking side of the web which can be possible by having a good <strong>Web Browser</strong>.</p>
        <p>Netscape has its own which is Netscape Navigator and Microsoft based on <strong>NCSA Mosaic</strong> created Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p class="quote">Browser War I had been more of a coup â€“ when half the Mosaic team defected in early 1994 and formed Netscape under entrepreneur Jim Clark, Mosaic lasted less than a year. But when Microsoft licenses a version of Mosaic and rebrands it Internet Explorer, the fight is on.</p>

        <p>At the moment Marc Andresson has more insight than Microsoft's developers. He notices that having <strong>static HTML page</strong> is limited and maybe if we could make it dynamically be a better option on a web browser.</p>
        <img width="100%" title="Marc Andreessen"  src="/build/img/Marc-Andreessen.jpg" alt="Marc-Andreessen.jpg">
        <p>The idea of having a way to dynamically change HTML on the page finally led Mrac Andresson to come up with the idea of a dynamic scripting language which we know it today as JavaScript.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Java in 1995</h3>
        <p>Java programming language was also released in this year.</p>
        <p class="quote">Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. </p>
        <p>And since Java was getting more and more popular why not creating a smaller Java-link scripting language?</p>
        <p>It seems a good idea, is not it? For the back-end side we have Java. Why not having Java-Script for the client side?</p>
        <p>Sun Microsystems let Marc Andreessen to use the word <stronge>Java</stronge> in their new scripting language and the reason for both side way simple.</p>
        <p>Sun Microsystems could say our programming language - Java - works at both side. And Netscape could say we are as good as Java is!</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Oh Microsoft</h3>
        <p>The problem that Marc Andreessen was seeing was that at any moment it might Microsoft would come up with a new programming language or technologies that could beat them.</p>
        <p>So for beating Microsoft and being the first in the market for having a dynamic web browser Marc Andreessen decided to have a scripting language but as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Result?</p>
        <p>JavaScript</p>




        <h3 class="sub-title">JavaScript in 10 days</h3>
        <p class="quote">In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator.[16]</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p class="quote">Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun Microsystems to include Sun's more static programming language, Java, in Netscape Navigator so as to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web technologies and platforms.[17]</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p class="quote">Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.</p>
        <p>but, but, but! JavaScript is syntactically is like Java and at its code is Scheme.</p>
        <p class="quote">Scheme was created during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab and released by its developers, Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman, via a series of memos now known as the Lambda Papers. It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for <strong>functional programming</strong> and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms.</p>
        <p>We will talk more about functional programming later on.</p>
        <p>Finally ...</p>
        <p class="quote">To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> wrote one in 10 days, in May 1995.</p>
        <img width="100%" title="Brendan Eich" src="/build/img/1995.javascript.jpg" alt="1995.javascript.jpg">
        <p>Also</p>
        <p class="quote">Although it was developed under the name <strong>Mocha</strong>, the language was officially called <strong>LiveScript</strong> when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed <strong>JavaScript</strong> when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December.[2][18] </p>
