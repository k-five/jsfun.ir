		<h1>1991</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>All the things happened before this year (= 1991) - we talked about - leaded us to have two important change for the web world..</p>
        <p>Although we have other new techs in 1991 like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AMD Am386</li>
            <li>Intel i486SX</li>
            <li>Notebook introduced by most PC vendors</li>
            <li>First color image scanner</li>
            <li>First stereo Creative Labs sound card</li>
            <li>First multimedia PC standard</li>
            <li>Symantec releases Norton anti-virus software</li>
            <li>Microsoft changes the name of OS/2 v3.0 to Windows NT</li>
        </ul>
        <p>but none of these are important as these two ones we have here.</p>
        <p>Before it be forgotten we have <strong>Python</strong> in this year.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href=""></a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-title">first online web page</h3>
        <p>As we know so far Mr Lee could create some software</p>
        <ul>
            <li>first web browser</li>
            <li>first web server. Notice that web server is different than server.</li>
            <li>A kind of language that we know it today as HTML</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The idea was simple. Sending information from the server, with the help of web server to another server that this one has a software (= a browser) than can parse the incoming data from the web server and show them.</p>
        <p>This software for parsing data coming from a server, we know it today, a web browser like Firefox, Chrome, etc.</p>
        <p>So everything is working but it is not publicly our side of CERN for non technical users to see this innovation.</p>
        <p>Finally in</p>
        <p class="quote">The first website was built at CERN. Despite this being an international organisation hosted by Switzerland, the office that Berners-Lee used was just across the border in France.[37] The website was put online on <strong>6 August 1991</strong> for the first time</p>
        <p>And here is the first online web page:</p>
        <p><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a></p>
        <p class="quote">I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide We</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notice that you are viewing a page from 1991 with a web browser in 2019! At that time it was not that beautiful.</p>
        <p>Also notice that the first domain address is not <strong>.com</strong> and it is <strong>.ch</strong> hosted by CERN.</p>
        <p>And three <strong>WWW</strong> path name which is name of the project: <strong>World Wide Web</strong>.</p>
        <p class="quote">Berners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book Weaving The Web, he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies: </p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p class="quote">a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as uniform resource locator (URL) and uniform resource identifier (URI)</p>
        <p>2.</p>
        <p class="quote">the publishing language Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</p>
        <p>3.</p>
        <p class="quote">the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web</a></li>
        </ul>


        
        <h3 class="sub-title">first open source kernel</h3>
        <p>The second important event in this year is that Mr Torvalds announced an open source kernel.</p>
        <p class="quote">In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about operating systems.[39] Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only,[38] he began to work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Putting it all to gather</h3>
        <p>From one slide of these two stories we Mr. Lee with its web server, web browser and publicly available and on the other side with Mr. Torvalds and we have an open source kennel available for all.</p>
