        <hr>
        <p>After R&amp;D about <a href="http://jsfun.me/the-world-of-javascript">the world of javascript</a> I had a better felling about javascript; also more experiences; so I do not want to mix it with the <strong>the world of javascript</strong> topic and decided to share it on a separate topic.</p>
        <p>Since I already wrote about a review of <strong>Effective JavaScript</strong> book, this one became <strong>Effective JavaScript 2</strong>.</p>
        <p>Please notify me, or edit each post if you found any mistakes. Thanks you.</p>
