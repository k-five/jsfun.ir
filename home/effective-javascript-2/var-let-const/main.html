        <p>We know that JavaScript is a <strong>dynamic typed language</strong>.</p>
        <p>Thus it lets us easily change the type of variables or date we have.</p>
        <p>For example</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// declare a variable using let
let name = "JS"; // type is string

// change the type to number
name = 2019</code></pre>
        
        <p>If we change the type of variable often, we encounter two problems:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Compiler Overhead Optimization</li>
            <li>Side Effect Propagation</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In modern JS engine we have two phases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Baseline Compilation (= Interpreter)</li>
            <li>Compiler Optimization (= Compiler)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In fact at first JS engine reads the JS code as an <strong>interpreter</strong> and for optimizing it one more time tries to compile it to machine code.</p>
        <p>So the second phase is for making the code faster.</p>
        <p>If we change the type of data we have, then the optimization phase cannot be succeeded and passes the code to another phase which is <strong>de-optimize</strong> phase.</p>
        <p>Result? Overhead</p>
        <p>The lesson here is that as much as we can, we should avoid changing the type of data we use.</p>
        <p>Since we have:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>var</li>
            <li>let</li>
            <li>const</li>
        </ol>
        <p>the best one for us will be <strong>const</strong> keyword.</p>
        <p>I know that const keyword for <strong>Array</strong> and <strong>Object</strong> has no effect and cannot prevent them from modification but as a best practice it is preferable to use const.</p>
        <p>And not just for avoiding compiler overhead but also to practice <strong>Functional Programming</strong> technique that we become familiar with it in other posts.</p>
