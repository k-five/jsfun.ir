        <p>Some other types of function in JavaScript</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">6. IIFE</h3>
        <p>We already know that IIFE means <strong>Immediately Invoked Function Expression.</strong>.</p>
        <p>It is the happening of <strong>declaration</strong> plus <strong>invocation</strong> at the same time.</p>
        <p>So we declare and invoke the function right away.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="../../effective-javascript/variable-scope/immediately-invoked-function-expression">immediately-invoked-function-expression</a></p>
        
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">7. HOC</h3>
        <p>A very useful and practical technique which is a kind of <strong>declarative interface</strong> for hiding our imperative code using a simple <strong>Inversion of Control</strong> mechanism.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="../../effective-javascript/working-with-functions/higher-order-functions">higher-order-functions</a></p>
        
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">8. Callback</h3>
        <p>Register a function when the operation is asynchronous so we get the result of our registered function later on.</p>

        
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">9. Arrow Function</h3>
        <p>New ES6 function that has no <strong>this binding</strong>.</p>
        <p>When know that every JavaScript function has an implicit this binding. And it is referred to an object that calls that function.</p>
        <p>With arrow function, if we assign it to an object as a property (we call this method); then this method has no access to this!</p>
        <p>It is mostly useful for passing it around as an argument to a function and when we do not need to bind this.</p>
        

        <h3 class="sub-title">10. Closure</h3>
        <p>Very powerful mechanism or technique or pattern that captures reference to the outer scope data / function for later use case or execution.</p>
        <p>Closures are very useful and have many use cases like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>lazy evaluation or lazy algorithm</li>
            <li>partial application</li>
            <li>currying</li>
            <li>memoization</li>
        </ul>
