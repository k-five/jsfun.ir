        <hr>
        <p>Today we are going to look at inside a web browser which is Firefox.</p>
        <p>All the time we talk about JavaScript, JavaScript and today we see where is this JavaScript.</p>
        <p>If you have opened Firefox, closed it completely.</p>
        <p>Then open you Terminal.</p>
        <p>Then open your Firefox and do not do anything with it. It should have one tab opened.</p>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Processes</h3>
        <p>On your Terminal type to get all processes related to Firefox</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">pidof firefox | tr ' ' '\n' | sort -h

// which gives you something like this
4084
5282
5597
5822</code></pre>
        <p>The first one <strong>4084</strong> is the parent process id or main process id for Firefox itself.</p>
        <p>The second one is the child process id which is the active tab we have.</p>
        <p>The other two are also children and are reserved processes.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Parent and Children</h3>
        <p>We can see them in tree mode of the <strong>ps</strong> command.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>parent</strong>: 4084</li>
            <li><strong>children</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>child</strong>: 5282</li>
                <li><strong>child</strong>: 5597</li>
                <li><strong>child</strong>: 5822</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>try:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"> ps -ocmd,ppid,pid,nlwp,state --forest $(pidof firefox)

// output

 \_ /usr/lib/firefox/firefo  4084  5822   19 S</code></pre>
        <p>Also those options are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>cmd</strong>: command that is running</li>
            <li><strong>ppid</strong>: parent process id</li>
            <li><strong>pid</strong> process id</li>
            <li><strong>nlwp</strong> number of threads a process has</li>
            <li><strong>state</strong> the sate of a process which here is <strong>S</strong> and means sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>--forest</strong>: show the output in tree mode</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More info about "state" option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R    running or runnable (on run queue)
// ours
S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T    stopped by job control signal
t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
X    dead (should never be seen)
Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent</code></pre>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Threads</h3>
        <p>For seeing where is JavaScript we have show the threads inside a child process.</p>
        <p>Try this command, looking at threads inside <strong>5282</strong> process</p>

        <p>To better understand these threads I asked a question on Stack-Overflow and there is no answer to it.</p>
        <p><a target="_blnak" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57959772/what-are-js-watchdog-js-helper-timer-threads-inside-a-web-browsers-process">What are JS Watchdog, JS Helper, Timer threads inside a web browser's process</a></p>
        <p>So if I could not find the correct answers the explanation will be my best guess!</p>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">JS Watchdog</h3>
        <i>This section maybe wrong, please clarify me!</i>
        <p>What I found through searching:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=472702"> using watchdog thread in js shell to trigger operation callback</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=871079">Don't trigger operation callback from watchdog unless JS has been running long enough</a></li>
            <li><a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiJgIyT_NfkAhVMzKQKHcNiCyUQFjADegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWatchdog_timer&usg=AOvVaw1aVlNm4ua9Aya5GfLXPg7Y>Watchdog timer - Wikipedia</a></li>
        </ul>
       <p>None of these  directly explain the role of <strong>JS Watchdog thread</strong>.</p>
       <p>My best guess is that this thread takes care of running long time operation to prevent browser crash.</p>
       <p>For example:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>infinite for loop</li>
           <li>too much recursive function calls</li>
       </ul>
       <p>In such cases the threads tries to stop that operation!</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// sample for too long call stack
(function ff(){ ff() })();

// output on devtools
InternalError: too much recursion</code></pre>

        <h3 class="sub-title">JS Helper</h3>
        <i>This section maybe wrong, please clarify me!</i>
        <p>My best guess about these two <strong>JS Helper thread</strong> is that they are responsible for main JS code and Asynchronous code.</p>
        <p>In face one of them is kind of main thread JS and the other one is the helper thread for running asynchronous events.</p>
        <p>We know that in modern JS we have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Main Task</li>
            <li>Macro Task</li>
            <li>Micro Task</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The my best guess is that these two threads are for Main Task and Micro Task.</p>
        <p>Because I know that Timer functionality in JS is Macro Task.</p>
        <p>We will see in code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// sample
|const log = console.log.bind( console );

log( "start of main task" );

setTimeout(function(){
    log( "this is a Macro Task" );
}, 1000 );
// declare a function 
function f(){
    log( "this is function f()" );
}

// invoke it
f();

log( "end of main task" );

// output
--- start of main task ---
this is function f()
--- end of main task ---
this is a Macro Task
</code></pre>
        <p>As you can see the Macro Task is done of the Main Tasks are done.</p>
        <p>In fact we the JS file is executed the <strong>setTimeout()</strong> function has asynchronous nature and therefor it is put on a helper thread to be executed after 1000 milliseconds.</p>
        <p>So when the main JS thread's tasks are all done, the tasks on Event Queue is executed and here the setTimeout() is on the Event Queue.</p>
        <p><strong>How about Micro Tasks?</strong></p>
        <p>It is the same as Macro Task, but has higher priority. Like what? Like Promise.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const log = console.log.bind( console );

log( "--- start of main task ---" );

async function  microTask(){
    await null;
    log( "this is a Micro Task" );
}

// registered for later execution
setTimeout(function(){
    log( "this is a Macro Task" );
},0);

// run after setTimeout
// registered for later execution
microTask();

// declare a function 
function f(){
    log( "this is function f()" );
}

// executed right now
f();

log( "--- end of main task ---" );

// output
--- start of main task ---
this is function f()
--- end of main task ---
this is a Micro Task
this is a Macro Task</code></pre>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Timer</h3>
        <i>This section maybe wrong, please clarify me!</i>
        <p>And my best guess for <strong>Timer threads</strong> is that it takes care of asynchronous operations related to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>setTimer() function</li>
            <li>setInterval() function</li>
        </ul>
        <p>if we change our function added for setTimeout to a promise, we will get the same output again.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const log = console.log.bind( console );

log( "--- start of main task ---" );

async function  microTask(){
    await null;
    log( "This is a Micro Task" );
}

setTimeout(async function(){
    await null;
    log( "this is a Macro Task with Promise" );
},0);

// run after setTimeout
microTask();

// declare a function 
function f(){
    log( "this is function f()" );
}

// invoke it
f();

log( "--- end of main task ---" );


// output:
--- start of main task ---
this is function f()
--- end of main task ---
This is a Micro Task
this is a Macro Task with Promise</code></pre>
        <p>Because still setTimeout() function has less priority.</p>
        <p>How about adding extra operation to a micro task? Can we make it to be executed after a Macro task. No.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// notice the for loop inside the promise
const log = console.log.bind( console );

log( "--- start of main task ---" );

async function  microTask(){
    await null;
    let index = 0;
    log( "index:", index );
    for( ; index < 1000000000; ++index);
    log( "index:", index );
    log( "This is a Micro Task" );
}

setTimeout(async function(){
    log( "this is a Macro Task with Promise" );
},0);

// run after setTimeout
microTask();

// declare a function
function f(){
    log( "this is function f()" );
}

// invoke it
f();

log( "--- end of main task ---" );


// output
--- start of main task ---
this is function f()
--- end of main task ---
index: 0
index: 1000000000
This is a Micro Task
this is a Macro Task with Promise
</code></pre>
        <p>As you can see although we added a long running for loop but setTimeout() function has to wait till finishing the for loop operation.</p>
        <p>The two points here are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Micro tasks have higher priority</li>
            <li>the asynchronous operations on the helper thread are queued if we have many!</li>
        </ul>
