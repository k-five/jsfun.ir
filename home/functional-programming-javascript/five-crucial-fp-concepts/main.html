        <p>Before diving into those five concepts, here is a quick review for each one.</p>
        <p>Note  that learning path for these concepts is from top to bottom, in this way</p>
        <ol>
            <li>function as first class citizen</li>
            <li>closure</li>
            <li>currying</li>
            <li>partial application</li>
            <li>composition</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While their <strong>dependency flow</strong> is from bottom to top. For using <strong>composition</strong> we should be able to use <strong>partial application</strong>. For partial application we should be able to use <strong>currying</strong>; and so on.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>composition</li>
            <li>partial application</li>
            <li>currying</li>
            <li>closure</li>
            <li>function as first class citizen</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="sub-title">function as first class citizen</h3>
        <p>Not only we are able to use a function as a block of code that can be executed many times, but also we are able to store them as a data, pass it around, or return it from other functions.</p>
        

        <h3 class="sub-title">closure</h3>
        <p>Having access to outer scope variables (= data) by reference, even when the outer scope function has been executed, but still we have access to those variables (= data).</p>


        <h3 class="sub-title">currying</h3>
        <p>Some consecutive nested unary functions. That is it. Their return value is the next function in the series.</p>


        <h3 class="sub-title">partial application</h3>
        <p>Just using one part of a curry function not all at once.</p>


        <h3 class="sub-title">composition</h3>
        <p>The act of combining some curried functions (= have been partially applied).</p>
        <p>Comping functions from right to left is said <strong>compose</strong> and from left to right is said <strong>pipe</strong>.</p>
        <p>We will see each one in more details in next posts.</p>
