        <p>Many people know that JS's syntax was planed to be alike Java. But a few ones know that its functionality (= Architecture) is based on Schema which itself is based on Lisp and Lisp is a functional language.</p>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Closure</h3>
        <p>Although the concept of closures comes from functional programming languages, but JS (= JS developers) started to use it frequently in their code and slowly it shows the shiny part of JS for its usage in FP paradigm.</p>
        <p>Also adding new features to the language specially <strong>ES6 (=2015)</strong> showed that FP part plays a great role into JS.</p>
        <p>For Example <strong>Promises</strong> are based on <strong>Maybe Monads</strong> which is a FP concepts.</p>
        <p>It does not mean that <strong>OOP</strong> is bed, is dead, etc, definitely we need it, but having FP concepts and techniques in our toolbox help us to solve our problems differently if it would be possible.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Haskell</h3>
        <p>Before using JS, I wanted to learn FP using Kaskell and after one week I gave up because these were new to me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the syntax</li>
            <li>the concepts</li>
            <li>the techniques and idiom</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Which makes it hard to forward these three at the same time for me that was familiar with C, and C++.</p>
        <p>But with JS which its syntax is alike Java and Java is based on C++, it will be easier to learn <strong>concepts</strong> and <strong>techniques</strong>.</p>
        <p>In these series of posts we review core concepts and techniques using <strong>bottom-up approach</strong> which means seeing the implementation and concepts at the same time rather than first talk about <strong>concepts</strong> (= mathematically) and do little or no code.</p>
        <p>Follow this new series and if there were a mistakes in any cases, please notify me on github.</p>
